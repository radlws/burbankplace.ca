    +'At Burbank Place, we take recycling seriously.  Staying green is an important part for us as a co-op. '
    +'All members are to follow the city\'s recycling guidelines. We encourage our members to know what can and cannot be recycled. '
    +'We provide all the bins at the rear of the building where you will find a place for paper, glass and plastics, and organic waste. '
    +' One of the tasks available at the co-op is overseeing recycling and waste disposal activities. '
    +'The co-op couldn\'t be an environmentally friendly place without a recycling program in place.  Together we can make a difference!'
