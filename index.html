                            <p>Burbank Place Apartments is located in downtown Hamilton. It has been providing quality,
                                secure and affordable co-op living in the Hamilton area for over 60 years. The people who live here,
                                or "shareholders" run the building. Members have equal
                                voting rights and make all major decisions. All members are expected to participate in the running of the co-op.
                            </p><p>
                            The apartment building is comprised of 36 units, consisting of bachelor, one, two bedroom units.
                            Public transportation, schools, libraries, community centres, shopping and a variety of businesses are in
                            close proximity to the co-op. The Co-op is registered under the Corporations Act. Unit owners do hold capital
                            stock of the company that give them exclusive rights to their units. Purchasing shares allocated to a particular unit
                            gives the owner exclusive rights to that unit, and acquiring shares is a method of real estate ownership similar to
                            that of the newer condominium ownership. The board of directors of the company are shareholders appointed to the position
                            at the Annual General Meeting. They are responsible for overseeing the whole buildings running and maintenance operations.
                            The board works hard to run and maintain the building with the help of all shareholders.
