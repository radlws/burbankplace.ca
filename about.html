                                    <h3>The Board of Directors</h3>

                                    <p>
                                        Participation on the Board of Directors is an excellent way to learn about the
                                        running a cooperative community as well as managing a property.
                                        The Board recommends by-law amendments for approval by shareholders at the Annual
                                        General Meetings. Board members approve financials, review monthly financial
                                        statements and meet yearly with
                                        Accountants to review the operating budget before it is brought to the General
                                        Membership for approval.
                                        The board meets at least once a month to oversee the financial management of the
                                        co-operative. Some of the functions include assisting in preparing the annual
                                        budget, monitoring the buildings financial position and arrears,
                                        and regularly reporting & communicating to the Board of Directors and the
                                        shareholders.
                                        If a shareholder falls into arrears, the Board meets with that member and
                                        attempts to find a solution, while at the same time balancing the buildings need
                                        to operate as a financially viable organization.
                                        Board members must be fair and impartial and willing to devote one or two
                                        evenings each month.
                                        The board of directors duties can be broken into finance, member selection,
                                        building improvements and maintenance, social and living issues, as well as
                                        regular operating activities.
                                        Elections are held each year after the close of the fiscal year.
                                    </p>
